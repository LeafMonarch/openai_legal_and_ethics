            <p>
                A moral action is right if it follows rules, duties, or promises —
                regardless of the outcome.

            <h3>How It Applies to OpenAI</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>OpenAI originally promised openness, transparency, and developing AGI for all of humanity.</li>
                <li>Transitioning into a capped-profit (and later heavily commercial) entity breaks those original duties.</li>
                <li>The moral contract with contributors, researchers, and the public may have been violated.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Did OpenAI break its duty to benefit humanity?</li>
                <li>Was branding itself as “Open” misleading regarding training data?</li>
                <li>Is withholding data sources a violation of transparency?</li>
            </ul>
